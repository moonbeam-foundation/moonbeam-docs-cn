 - **Lead-in Period** — the initial proposal voting and discussion period. At this stage, proposals are in an undecided state until they pass some criteria for the given Track. The criteria include:
   
 - **带入期** — 最初的提案投票和讨论期。在此阶段，提案处于未定状态直至其通过指定Track的某些标准，包括：
   
    - **Prepare Period** — the minimum time the referendum needs to wait before it can progress to the next phase after submission
    - **准备期** — 公投提交后进入一下阶段前需要等待的最短时间
    - **Capacity** — limit for the number of referenda on a given Track that can be decided at once
    - **容量** — 一次可以决定指定Track上公投数量的限制
    - **Decision Deposit** — the minimum deposit amount required for a referendum to progress to the decision phase after the end of the Lead-in Period. Since each Track has a defined Capacity, this deposit is larger than the submission deposit, and its goal is to mitigate spam 
    - **决定保证金** — 在带入期结束后公投进入决定期所需的最低保证金金额。由于每个Track有一个固定的容量，此保证金要高于提交的保证金，其目的是防止不良提案的提交
    
    Tracks have different criteria parameters that are proportional to their level of Origin class. For example, more dangerous and privileged referenda will have more safeguards, higher thresholds, and longer consideration periods for approval.
    
    Track会有不同的标准参数，这些参数与Origin级别成正比。举例而言，更重要和特权的公投将有更多的保障、更高的门槛和更长的批准审议期。
