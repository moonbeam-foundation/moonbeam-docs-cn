Before diving into the steps for submitting a proposal, you'll want to get familiar with [Moonbeam's Community Forum](https://forum.moonbeam.foundation/){target=_blank}. It's highly recommended that you preface any proposal with a post on the forum to solicit feedback. You should allow a period of five days for the community to discuss and provide feedback on the Moonbeam Forum post before proceeding to submit the preimage and proposal.

在开始操作提交提案的步骤之前，您需要先熟悉[Moonbeam社区论坛](https://forum.moonbeam.foundation/){target=_blank}平台。强烈建议您先在论坛上发布任何提案相关的帖子以接收社区反馈。在继续提交原像和提案之前，您需要预留5天时间供社区讨论并在Moonbeam社区论坛帖子上提供反馈。

When you're ready to create a post with the details of your proposal, you can head to the **Governance** page and click on **Democracy Proposals**.

From there, you can click on **Open Draft** and begin to draft your proposal using the template provided. Make sure to update the title of the post and add any of the optional tags, such as **Moonbeam** if the proposal is for the Moonbeam network. The title should follow the format as the pre-populated title: [Proposal: XX][Status: Idea] proposal title. For example, [Proposal: XX][Status: Idea] Register XC-20 xcMYTOK. The XX will need to be updated with the proposal ID once the proposal has been formally submitted on-chain.

然后点击**Open Draft**，使用提供的模板开始准备提案草案。确保更新帖子标题并添加相关标签，比如**Moonbeam**（如果提案与Moonbeam相关）。标题应遵循[Proposal: XX][Status: Idea]提案标题的格式。例如，[Proposal: XX][Status: Idea]注册XC-20 xcMYTOK。其中XX将在提案正式在链上提交后被更新为提案ID。
