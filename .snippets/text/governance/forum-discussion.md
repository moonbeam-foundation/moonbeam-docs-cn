## Forum Discussion 论坛讨论 {: #forum-discussion} 

A vote on a democracy referenda is a binary outcome. However, a token holder's opinion is often more nuanced than yes/no, which is why it's strongly recommend that you preface any proposal with a post on [Moonbeam's Community Forum](https://forum.moonbeam.foundation/){target=_blank}. 

民主公投的投票是一个二元结果。然而，Token持有者的意见往往不只是赞成/反对。因此建议您先在[Moonbeam社区论坛](https://forum.moonbeam.foundation/){target=_blank}上发布有关提案详情的帖子。

The forum serves the critical role of providing a platform for discussion and allowing proposers to receive feedback from the community prior to an on-chain action. Creating a post on the forum is quick and easy as shown in the [Using the Moonbeam Community Forum](https://moonbeam.network/blog/using-moonbeam-community-forum/){target=_blank} guide. There are categories corresponding to each type of proposal, including democracy, treasury, and grant proposals. While this step is optional, explaining the details of the proposal and following up with any questions raised may increase the chances of the initiative being accepted and subsequently passed by the community. 

Moonbeam社区论坛的关键作用是为社区提供讨论并允许提议者在链上行动之前接收来自社区反馈的平台。正如[使用Moonbeam社区论坛](https://moonbeam.network/blog/using-moonbeam-community-forum/){target=_blank}的教程中所述，在论坛上创建帖子非常简单且快速。每个提案类型都有对应的类别，包括治理、财政库和grant提案。此步骤可选择操作，但是解释提案的详情并且跟进提出的任何问题可能会增加社区赞成和提案通过的可能性。
